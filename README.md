# syllogistic-provers

These are some syllogistic provers I made over the summer of 2017.

Inspired by Larry Moss's M482 course in Mathematical Logic, 
and Dan Friedman's C311 course in Programming Language Principles,
I used miniKanren to make provers for some basic logical systems covered in Moss's class.
